# Swift Rules for Cursor in Markdown Format

This repository includes a [rules](swiftrules.md) file in markdown format for [Swift](https://www.swift.org) iOS app development. It supports the following extensions in Cursor, VSCode, and other editors:

- **[Sweetpad](https://sweetpad.hyzyla.dev)** for building iOS apps at the command line with Xcode.
- **[InjectionIII](https://github.com/johnno1962/InjectionIII)** for hot reloading SwiftUI views.

These guidelines help you maintain clean, scalable, and maintainable code by leveraging the latest SwiftUI features while building your projects with the [VIPER architecture](https://medium.com/@pinarkocak/understanding-viper-pattern-619fa9a0b1f1). 

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7BVmsZSmWQ) demonstrates how to set up Sweetpad and InjectionIII, and it also links to [Swift Cursor Rules](https://www.rayfernando.ai/swift-cursor-rules) by Ray Fernando & Lou Zell which heavily influenced these guidelines and includes some verbatim text.
